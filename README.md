# Student_Result_Management_Portal

- A Student result portal project focuses on technologies used: Java, Java Swing, Jframe, and MySQL database.
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is used for MySQL functions and Netbeans IDE for the project.
- The goal is to build the admin & the student section. Here the role of the admin is to add the details of students and their results in the portal.
- The role of the student is to view only the results. And the student doesn't have any permission to alter/update details.
- Whatever the details entered in frontend the details/data are stored in the MySQL database. With the help of that, the student can view their results.
